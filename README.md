Eurorack format Quantizer with Arduino Nano
(based on Hagiwo Modulars original Design)

Feature List:


Scale Modes:
The Scale is chosen by turning the Encoder Knob:

1. Chromatic
2. Major
3. Major Pentatonic
4. Major Pentatonic + 7
5. Natural Minor

Root Modes:
The Root-Note is Selected by turning the same Encoder Knob while held pressed down!
With the Rotate function All Scales are availiable from C, C-sharp, D, D-Sharp, E .... A, A-Sharp, B. So no need to transpose your oscillator anymore!
Every Scale Mode is availiable with every Root Note Selected!


CV-Modes:
The CV-Mode is chosen by double clicking (and holding) the encoder button and turning the knob while pressed!
CV-modes determin what the Mode CV input does:

1. Control Slide Function via CV (ON or OFF)
2. Control Slide Time via CV, in addition to what is set on the Slide Knob
3. Select the Scales via CV
4. Select the Root Note via CV
5. Transpose the incoming Pitch CV in Semitone-Steps
6. Transpose the incoming Pitch CV in Fifths (7 Semitones)
7. Transpose the incoming Pitch CV in Octaves (12 Semitones)
